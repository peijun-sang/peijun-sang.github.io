      <description>&lt;p&gt;The actor is often thought of as a performer, someone who takes on different&#xA;roles and personas in front of an audience. But what if we were to extend that&#xA;logic and think of the actor as a gander?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just like a gander, the actor is a visitor in different worlds, experiencing&#xA;them for a brief moment in time before moving on to the next. The gander&#xA;gracefully glides on the surface of the water, taking in the scenery and&#xA;observing the world around it. Similarly, the actor immerses themselves in a&#xA;character and the world of the play, taking in the emotions and experiences of&#xA;the role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
